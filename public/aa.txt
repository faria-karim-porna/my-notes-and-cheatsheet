So far I have done manual testing, fixed the bugs on the code, done some sort of refactoring, created new features like drag and drop based file uploader, search bar with dropdown options.
==========================================
Q: Do you prefer to work in team or solo?
A: Actually both of the areas have different advantages. The advantage of teamwork is that many large scale projects can be completed in a relatively short amount of time due to work sharing. There is a scope of sharing knowledge with others in a team work. Because of involvement of many people, team members get guidance and help. It is possible to create something innovative by combining the strong skills of the team members. On the other hand, a person can do whatever he thinks is beneficial if he is doing everything all alone. He can takes decision quickly. No one has to take the responsibility of team management.

==========================================
Q: Which programming language do you like most?
A: Actually it depends on the type of projects. If the project is a web app or mobile app then I will prefer Javascript. Because it is possible to build interactive UI very easily using js. I think no other programming languages can beat js in this area. There are many efficient and helpful frontend frameworks which are written in js.
==========================================
Q: Tell us about your best project? 
A: My best project was my thesis project. It was mainly a machine learning based project by which we were trying to predict the uttered word without any sound only based on lip movement. To build this project, our motive was to help the mute people. Durning the time of implementation of this project I have faced a lot of challenges. 
==========================================
Q: What kind of challenges do you have faced in this project?
A: The first challenge which I have faced was about dataset. Actually we were dealing with Bengali based audiovisual dataset. But unfortunately we have not found any related dataset. To solve this problem we have built our own dataset by using movie.py. The source of raw data was news presentations. Next challenge which we faced was about dataset representation and mapping output with input. As we were working on video dataset of variable length, so I found it really very challenging. We have cutted each videos into frames. Then we grouped together all the frames which belong to the same video. After that we grouped videos based on their output labels. To make the number of frames equal for each video we used zero padding to our feature vector.
==========================================
Q: What technologies have you used in your best project?
A: To split the videos based on uttered words and to convert them into frames we used movie.pyn We used keras tensorflow to build the model. Opencv and facial landmark is used to track the lip movement. We used geometric shape of lip to extract feature and lstm is used as language model.
==========================================



Q: Why do you want to switch your current job?
A: I have thoroughly enjoyed working for my employer and I have achieved some great things whilst I have been there. I must say my colleagues and senior were very friendly and helpful there. They have guided me well as a fresher. There was a work life balance in my previous company. But suddenly because of some personal reasons, I have to shift my home. And now my office location has become far away from my home.
==========================================
Q: Why do you want more salary?
A: See, as how I see it since I have diverse skillset and have the ability to adopt different technologies and I have performed really well in my previous company and learned a lot of things. I would continue to do that here as well  so I think It's an investment worth making.
