It is more important to be good in writing English than speaking English
Write 10-15 mins daily it becomes your thought more clear
Read books aloud it helps you to think in English. it makes the thought directly to word.
In front of mirror see if your toungue can speak in a smooth flow
When you practice speech focus on first grammer and vocabulary, then pace and smoothness, last accent and tonality. You need at least 50 days for this.
Only writing with a grammer check + reading books aloud for 15 mins each for 50 days.
If you find you do not have fluency in transition between sentences the practice debating / door to door or stage speaking.
Learn from good speakers and youTube videos. You get knowledge about when to take high pace and when to take low pace.
Clear is always better than clever.
Google common grammatical mistakes.
Use short texts rather than long. If you can communicate with 5 words dont use 7 words.
Give yourself at least 15 days to judge your progress.

Mistakes we do while learning English is we learn fron non native English speakers, we learn with so many rules, we dont follow consistency, we try to memorize things.
Follow this structure => listening, speaking, reading, writing.
You can start with listening journey with watching movies.
You can increase your reading skill with children novels, high level novels then newspaper. In newspaper, after 20 days you will find repetitive words. It will help you to use those words.
Writing help you to put your thoughts into words.
Start speaking in English from day one.
