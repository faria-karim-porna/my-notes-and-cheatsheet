    questions: `Tell us something about yourself which is not mentioned in your cv.`,
    answers: `Yeah sure. Thank you for the opportunity to share more about myself. I am Faria. Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at Kaz Software where I am involved in testing and debugging code, implementing best coding practices, and ensuring the software is scalable and efficient. 

    I have been working here since march of 2021. I have joined here as an associate software engineer. Recently I got promoted. 
    In my current company, I have mostly been involved in front-end development for a significant portion of the time. In the span of 2 years, I have been involved in implementing many new features and also have been part of the significant enhancements of the existing features using react.js, redux and typescript. Additionally, to date now I have done code reviews for the backend part of the application and also have worked on performance improvements, and have been involved in optimizing queries.
    
    Although I have worked relatively less in the backend field in my career so far, but I have used many backend technologies for the learning purpose in many of my personal projects. In those projects, my main focus was on performing CRUD operations and implementing robust authentication and authorization systems.
    
    Although I have a basic understanding of various backend technologies, I am mostly familiar with Node.js.
    
    I have completed my graduation from North South University in the year 2020. I have achieved the highest “Summa Cum Laude” prestige from my university for having an excellent CGPA.
    
    In my free time I love to watch indian and south indian movies. Movies which are based on student lives are my most favourite such as 3 idiots, chichore, vaathi, etc.
    
    My hobby is to do illustration and animation kind of stuff using powerpoint. I just love this tool. Every creative and artistic kind of things always fascinates me.

I have previous experience in rest api, react.js, oop. Mostly I am ready to take all the responsibilities. I am hopeful that I have the ability to prove myself as an important asset to the company.
// ==========================================
// Q: Do you have any plans for higher study?
// A: I don’t have any plans because I like practical stuffs more than theoretical studies and researches. I think things can be learnt quickly by implementing them. Although because of my CGPA it may seem like I put focus on theoretical stuffs but it is not like that. Actually I understood what my teachers teaches really well. I think I should utilize the things that I am good at. That's why I got good score in the theoretical topics. Moreover I always did contribution on my academic projects. I never wanted to be the person who did nothing in the project but only made her present on the day of submission.
// ==========================================
// Q: What are the tools/frameworks you learned recently?
// A: Recently I have learned typescript and redux based tools like redux toolkit, redux, redux thunk.
// ==========================================
// Q: What is your salary expectation?

So far I have done manual testing, fixed the bugs on the code, done some sort of refactoring, created new components like drag and drop based file uploader, search  bar with dropdown options.
// ==========================================
// Q: Do you prefer to work in team or solo?
// A: Actually both of the areas have different advantages. The advantage of teamwork is that many large scale projects can be completed in a relatively short amount of time due to work sharing. There is a scope of sharing knowledge with others in a team work. Because of involvement of many people, team members get guidance and help. It is possible to create something innovative by combining the strong skills of the team members. On the other hand, a person can do whatever he thinks is beneficial if he is doing everything all alone. He can takes decision quickly. No one has to take the responsibility of team management.
// ==========================================
// Q: What are the 3 positive sides of programming?
// A: I think there is a scope of showing creativity in programming. It is possible to ease people’s life by developing innovative softwares. There is a scope of always learning even without getting bored.
// ==========================================
// Q: Which programming language do you like most?
// A: Actually it depends on the type of projects. If the project is a web app or mobile app then I will prefer Javascript. Because it is possible to build interactive UI very easily using js. I think no other programming languages can beat js in this area. There are many efficient and helpful frontend frameworks which are written in js. On the otherhand for the data science based project, I will prefer python. Because there are many built in functions and libraries which are very helpful to implement data science based functionality. There are many machine learning frameworks in python like tensorflow, pytorch, scikit learn, keras. Another language I want to mention for game development and computer based app development is C#. This language is very popular for this two area.
// ==========================================
// Q: Tell us about your best project?
// A: My best project was my thesis project. Durning the time of implementation of this project I have faced a lot of challenges. It was mainly a machine learning based project by which we were trying to predict the uttered word without any sound only based on lip movement. To build this project, our motive was to help the mute people.
// ==========================================
// Q: What kind of challenges do you have faced in this project?
// A: The first challenge which I have faced was about dataset. Actually we were dealing with Bengali based audiovisual dataset. But unfortunately we have not found any related dataset. To solve this problem we have built our own dataset by using movie.py. The source of raw data was news presentations. Next challenge which we faced was about dataset representation and mapping output with input. As we were working on video dataset of variable length, so found it really very challenging. We have cutted each videos into frames. Then we grouped together all the frames which belong to the same video. After that we grouped videos based on their output labels. To make the number of frames equal for each video we used zero padding to our feature vector.
// ==========================================
// Q: What technologies have you used in your best project?
// A: To split the videos based on uttered words and to convert them into frames we used movie.pyn We used keras tensorflow to build the model. Opencv and facial landmark is used to track the lip movement. We used geometric shape of lip to extract feature and lstm is used as language model.
// ==========================================
// Q: Why do you want to switch your current job?
// A: I have thoroughly enjoyed working for my employer and I have achieved some great things whilst I have been there. I must say my colleagues and senior were very friendly and helpful there. They have guided me well as a fresher. There was a work life balance in my previous company. But suddenly because of some personal reasons, I have to shift my home. And now my office location has become far away from my home.
// ==========================================
// Q: Why do you want to switch your career path from Engineering to executive role?
// A: Although I am from an Engineering background but apart from this I was always interested in sales and marketing. Actually I am not switching my career path rather I am contributing more to the society by adding one more career path.
// ==========================================
// Q: Why should we hire you even you are from different background?
// A: I think it is a kind of art to be proficient in sales. According to me it is a must to have a good sales strategy for any company to standout in the marketplace and to grab the attention of the targeted customers. As I was a student of CSE department and most of your courses are based on different framework and Computer based technologies So I have well enough idea about the customers demands and expectations. Moreover few months ago I have completed an online based course. Though the course was about web development but being a student of an online based educational community I know how a well organised course structure can be beneficial for the both ends supplier and customer. Durning my varsity days I was involved in various extra curriculum activities. I was a general member of NSU CEC where I worked as a volunteer in one of their events. So I know better how to handle and communicate people with patience. I am quite interested in designing. I love to do designing using powerpoint. I think good and eye-catching designing in the advertisements  helps to accelerate the sales. In my company I have also create a presentation video on its 17th anniversary using powerpoint. I think my different background will not create any problem for the sale rather it will add an extra benefit to it.
// ==========================================
// Q: Why do you want to do part time job?
// A: Part time work allows me the time to pursue the many interests I have including sales and software development.
// ==========================================
// Q: Why do you want more salary?
// A: See, as how I see it since I have diverse skillset and have the ability to adopt different technologies and I have performed really well in my previous company and learned a lot of things. I I would continue to do that here as well  so I think It's an investment worth making.
