    questions: `Tell us something about yourself which is not mentioned in your cv.`,
    answers: `Yeah sure. Thank you for the opportunity to share more about myself. I am Faria. Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at Kaz Software where I am involved in testing and debugging code, implementing best coding practices, and ensuring the software is scalable and efficient. 

    I have been working here since march of 2021. I have joined here as an associate software engineer. Recently I got promoted. 
    In my current company, I have mostly been involved in front-end development for a significant portion of the time. In the span of 2 years, I have been involved in implementing many new features and also have been part of the significant enhancements of the existing features using react.js, redux and typescript. Additionally, to date now I have done code reviews for the backend part of the application and also have worked on performance improvements, and have been involved in optimizing queries.
    
    Although I have worked relatively less in the backend field in my career so far, but I have used many backend technologies for the learning purpose in many of my personal projects. In those projects, my main focus was on performing CRUD operations and implementing robust authentication and authorization systems.
    
    Although I have a basic understanding of various backend technologies, I am mostly familiar with Node.js.
    
    I have completed my graduation from North South University in the year 2020. I have achieved the highest “Summa Cum Laude” prestige from my university for having an excellent CGPA.
    
    In my free time I love to watch indian and south indian movies. Movies which are based on student lives are my most favourite such as 3 idiots, chichore, vaathi, etc.
    
    My hobby is to do illustration and animation kind of stuff using powerpoint. I just love this tool. Every creative and artistic kind of things always fascinates me.
    
    Yeah, that's pretty much about me.`,

    questions: `Tell me about a time when you faced a difficult technical problem. How did you approach it?`,
    answers: `Whenever I develop complex features, I often encounter technical problems . When I faced with a challenging technical problem, I first analyzed the problem to understand its root cause. Then, I researched potential solutions. I break down the whole problem into smaller parts and try to solve each part separately. I make an effort to tackle different cases or scenarios individually in order to find solutions. I sought input from colleagues if needed, and implemented the most suitable solution. I also documented the process for future reference and shared my learnings with the team.`,

  {
    questions: `Describe a situation where you had to work under pressure to meet a project deadline.`,
    answers: `Few months back I was working on a tax related project. In that project, we had to deliver a feature within a very short amount of time. To cope with the pressure, we focused on essential tasks, eliminated non-essential elements. We distributed our work based on our strength. I prioritized tasks,  communicated with the team to ensure everyone was on the same page, and leveraged my problem-solving skills to find efficient solutions. By staying focused and collaborating effectively, we successfully delivered the project on time.`,

    questions: `Can you share an experience when you had to handle conflicting requirements from stakeholders or clients?`,
    answers: `In one of the features of my current project,  I encountered conflicting requirements from different stakeholders regarding the design and functionality of a web app.  To address this, I initiated meetings with my team lead and other team members. By giving proper examples I made them understand the complexity of the design and the challenges we will face within the given time limitation. Then I presented compromise solutions that met everyone's requirements. This approach helped resolve conflicts, maintain stakeholder satisfaction, and keep the project on track.`,
