              In object oriented programming, we have to make our code reliable,
              scalable and highly maintainable. To make such code software
              developers often face some problems. There are some tested and
              proven template for these problems. They are called design
              patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
              A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the
              specific common object-oriented design problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Design patterns are programming language independent strategies
              (an idea, not a particular implementation).
            </li>
            <li>
              Every design pattern has some specification or set of rules for
              solving the problems. Design patterns are solutions to general
              problems that software developers faced during software
              development.
            </li>
            <li>
              These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous
              software developers over quite a substantial period of time.

            <li>
              Whenever there is a need, you have to implement a suitable pattern

              To find out which pattern to use. You just have to try to
              understand the design patterns and their purposes. Only by then,
              you will be able to pick the right one.
